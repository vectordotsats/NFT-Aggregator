Set of extensions and utilities for tokens (e.g ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) and derivated ERCs (e.g. ERC-4626, ERC-1363).

 * {OnTokenTransferAdapter}: Adapter of the ERC-1363 receiver interface to comply with Chainlink's 667 interface.
 * {ERC20Allowlist}: Extension of ERC20 with transfers and approvals that require users to be registered into an allowlist.
 * {ERC20Blocklist}: Extension of ERC20 with transfers and approvals that can be disabled by adding users into a blocklist.
 * {ERC20Collateral}: Oracle-agnostic extension of ERC20 that limits the total supply based on a collateral amount.
 * {ERC20Custodian}: Extension of ERC20 that implements an access-control agnostic approach to define a custodian that can freeze user's transfers and approvals.
 * {ERC4626Fees}: ERC4626 vault with fees on entry (deposit/mint) or exit (withdraw/redeem).
