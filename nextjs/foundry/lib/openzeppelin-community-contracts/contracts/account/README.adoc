NOTE: This document is better viewed at https://docs.openzeppelin.com/community-contracts/api/account

This directory includes contracts to build accounts for ERC-4337. These include:

 * {Account}: An ERC-4337 smart account implementation that includes the core logic to process user operations.
 * {AccountERC7579}: An extension of `Account` that implements support for ERC-7579 modules.
 * {AccountERC7579Hooked}: An extension of `AccountERC7579` with support for a single hook module (type 4).
 * {ERC7821}: Minimal batch executor implementation contracts. Useful to enable easy batch execution for smart contracts.
 * {ERC7579Validator}: Abstract validator module for ERC-7579 accounts that provides base implementation for signature validation.
 * {ERC7579SignatureValidator}: Implementation of ERC7579Validator using ERC-7913 signature verification for address-less cryptographic keys.
 * {PaymasterCore}: An ERC-4337 paymaster implementation that includes the core logic to validate and pay for user operations.
 * {PaymasterERC20}: A paymaster that allows users to pay for user operations using ERC-20 tokens.
 * {PaymasterERC20Guarantor}: A paymaster that enables third parties to guarantee user operations by pre-funding gas costs, with the option for users to repay or for guarantors to absorb the cost.
 * {PaymasterERC721Owner}: A paymaster that allows users to pay for user operations based on ERC-721 ownership.
 * {PaymasterSigner}: A paymaster that allows users to pay for user operations using an authorized signature.
